# RProtect
Prevent players from accidentally researching items they have already researched.

If they choose to override and create the blueprint again, they can.

A large red label appears to warn/notify, and they have 3 seconds to choose whether or not to create the blueprint by clicking the native "BEGIN RESEARCH" button.

There is no configuration or data storage for this plugin.
